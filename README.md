# Quaver SV Guide
This is a website dedicated to explaining everything about scroll velocities (SVs) in Quaver, the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive rhythm game.

I would consider this mostly a personal project of mine to practice front-end web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) as well as practice in trying to create an "organized course" of sorts to teach a topic (in this case, SVs).

If you are reading this right now, the website is 1% completed: you can access it but it has no content about SVs. Hopefully I can finish the bulk of the content by the end of 2021.
